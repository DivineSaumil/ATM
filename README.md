This is a CUI based ATM simulation. It utilizes MySQL database mydb to store data. It has a Admin Mode and User Mode.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
